# ds-project
The goal of this project is to study, analyze, cluster, and compare the neighborhoods of Downtown Toronto in Ontario, Canada and Manhattan in New York City, USA for various business located in each city. We will analyze the businesses are common in both cities, what kinds of businesses are more common in one of the two cities than the other city, and what kinds of businesses are not common in both cities.
This project will enable us to get a better understanding of similarities and differences between the two cities what types of businesses are more likely to thrive in both cities, what are the neighborhoods that are suitable for each type of business, and what types of businesses are not very desirable in each city. This allows business people to take better and more effective decisions regarding where to open their businesses.
